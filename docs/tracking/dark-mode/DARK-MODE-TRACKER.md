# Dark Mode Implementation Tracker

This document tracks the progress of dark mode implementation across the Mixcore application components.

## Overview

The dark mode implementation uses a theme system compatible with shadcn/ui components, leveraging CSS variables and the `class="dark"` approach for theme switching.

## Components Status

| Component | Status | Implementation Date | Notes |
|-----------|--------|---------------------|-------|
| GanttView | ✅ Complete | 2023-06-05 | Fully implemented with dark mode styling for toolbar, task bars, and dependencies |
| ProjectList | ⚠️ Partial | 2023-06-05 | Main component styled, but some elements may need additional styling |

## Implementation Guidelines

When implementing dark mode for components:

1. Use shadcn/ui components where possible which have built-in dark mode support
2. For custom elements, use the CSS variables defined in the theme
3. Test both themes thoroughly to ensure all elements are properly styled
4. Check for any hard-coded colors that might need to be replaced with theme variables
5. Ensure proper contrast ratios are maintained in both light and dark themes

## Next Steps

The following components should be prioritized for dark mode implementation:

- Complete ProjectList dark mode styling
- Calendar views
- Dashboard widgets
- Charts and data visualization components
- Settings panels
